run docker compose with specific file
docker-compose -f <your-compose-file-name> up



Run the following command:

Copy code
docker-compose down
This command will stop the running containers and remove the associated networks and volumes created by Docker Compose.

If you want to remove the containers and volumes but keep the networks intact, you can use the --volumes flag:

css
Copy code
docker-compose down --volumes
This will remove the containers and volumes but retain the networks defined in your Docker Compose file.

If you want to remove the containers, volumes, and networks, you can use the --volumes flag along with the --networks flag:

css
Copy code
docker-compose down --volumes --networks
This will remove all the containers, volumes, and networks created by Docker Compose.

Docker Compose will stop the containers and remove the associated resources.
